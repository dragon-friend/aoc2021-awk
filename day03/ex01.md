# Exercise 1 explanation

This exercise involved getting the most and leat common bits from a list of binary digits. This would have been simple for awk to do if it weren't for the fact that there were no delimiters between the bits and that the FIELDWIDTHS variable is a gnu extension.

`awk '{split($1,t,"");for(i in t)f[i]+=t[i]}END{for(i in f){(f[i]>NR/2)?g+=2^(length($1)-i):e+=2^(length($1)-i)}{print g*e}}' input`

Luckily, the `split()` function exists. 

I first split `$1` into a temporary array `t` with an empty delimiter, making it put each character into a different index.

After that, because `t` gets replaced every line, I tally each bit a final array `f`.

By the end of the file, each index of `f` contains the sum of every `i`th bit in the file, or put simply the amount of ones.

With this data, it becomes easy enough to loop through the array and check if the amount of ones in each index of `f` is more than half the total bits, in this case `NR`.

Putting this into a ternary lets me fill the `g` (Gamma) and `e` (Epsilon) variables by summing powers of 2 backwards, since the first index is the highest power. 

`length($1)` is here to count the total number of bits to fill and `length($1)-i` works for the purposes of this exercise because awk arrays start at 1.

There might be a bug in this solution because I was unable to tell what to do in the event that there were as many ones as there were zeros for any given index, so I went with strict superiority out of convenience.
