# Exercise 1 explanation

The exercise was to count the amount of lines that contain a number greater than the number on the previous line.

Awk makes this very simple

`'{n+=($0>a)}{a=$0}END{print n-1}'`

In this script, `n` is a counter variable, it is automatically set to 0 when created.

`n` is incremented whenever $0 (the current line during processing) is greater than a variable `a`.

`a` is also initialized to 0 here, and is only set to the current line after `n` is incremented.

This is because awk processes a file line by line, so setting the `a` to `$0` makes it the previous line for the next iteration.

The only issue with this script is that $0 will always be bigger than an unset variable, so after the processing is done, we print `n-1`.
