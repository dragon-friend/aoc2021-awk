# Exercise 2 explanation

The exercise was similar to ex01 except instead of lines it was groups of 3 lines.

The challenge here was finding the order of operations

`'{n+=(c>d)}{d=c}{c=$1+a+b}{b=a}{a=$1}END{print n-2}'`

In this script, `n` works the same as it did for ex01, where `c` and `d` are sums representing the groups of 3 lines.

`b` was added to serve the same purpose as `a` and stagger the column once more.

`c` then becomes the sum of `$1`, `a`, and `b`, and `d` serves as the previous sum, working in the same way that `a` does.
