# Exercise 2 explanation

Much like ex01, this one was fairly easy for awk to handle, the core principle was the same.

`awk {if($1=="forward"){h+=$2;d+=a*$2}else{($1=="up")?a-=$2:a+=$2}}END{print h*d} input`

This script is nearly identical to the one I used for ex01, I had to use an if statement to accomodate for the double incrementation if `$1` was `forward` and I changed the second ternary to affect `a` (the aim variable) instead.
