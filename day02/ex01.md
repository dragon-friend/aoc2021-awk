# Exercise 1 explanation

Awk felt made for this exercise, since all there was to do was to increment or decrement variables by the contents of column 2 based on the contents of column 1.

`awk {($1=="forward")?h+=$2:($1=="up")?d-=$2:d+=$2}END{print h*d}' input`

For this script I just used two ternary operators, one to increment `h` (the horizontal position varible) by `$2` (the data in the second column) if `$1` is `forward`, and the other to decide whether to increment or decrement  d (the depth variable) if `$1` is `up` or `down`.
